JavaScript Homework 2
=====================

For the exercise 1, I looped through the key elements and printed them out.

For the exercise 2, I Created a class Person and gave it two attributes that could get passed in when creating a new object. I created a method to print and a method to add one year to the initial age.

For the exercise 3, I created a promise based function two check if a string's length was greater than 10. I then made another promise based function with the same goal to show a different approach to creating Promise Based functions.
